Just to write clean OOP code with 3 constructors and get a feedback:
"...
we also know that Nothing good happens after making a constructor public
A public constructor will have illicit uses introduced within a code base. These uses necessarily will:
- make refactoring more difficult.
- break the interface-implementation abstraction barrier.
- introduce tighter coupling within a codebase.
...
After careful consideration we have decided not to take your application to the next step"
